# Summary Report: Time Series Anomaly Detection using NASA Bearing Dataset

## 1. Problem Understanding

Modern manufacturing systems rely on IoT sensors to monitor critical components such as bearings, motors, and turbines.  
Detecting anomalies in real-time sensor data is essential to prevent unexpected failures and enable predictive maintenance.

This project focuses on detecting **bearing anomalies** using the NASA Bearing Dataset.  
Each sample represents vibration data captured periodically during the machine’s operation until eventual bearing failure.

The goal is to:
- Identify unusual vibration patterns (spikes, drifts, sudden RMS changes)
- Compare traditional (statistical) and deep-learning approaches for anomaly detection
- Generate interpretable results suitable for early fault diagnosis

---

## 2. Dataset Description

- **Source:** NASA Bearing Data Center (Kaggle)
- **Type:** Time series from 4 vibration sensors
- **Sampling:** 20 kHz per file, sampled every 10 minutes
- **Files:** Each run until failure (~2000–3000 files)
- **Challenge:** No explicit anomaly labels; must infer abnormal periods

---

## 3. Approach Overview

The workflow is divided into five major stages:

### A. Data Preparation
- Read all sensor files in chronological order.
- Compute per-file statistics:
  - Mean, Standard Deviation, RMS, Kurtosis, Skewness, Peak-to-Peak.
- Combine them into a single DataFrame indexed by time.

### B. Feature Engineering
- Generated rolling window statistics (mean & std over 3, 5, 10 intervals)
- Added lag features and first differences.
- Scaled features using `StandardScaler` to standardize input ranges.

### C. Modeling
Implemented two approaches as required:

#### (1) Isolation Forest (Statistical / Unsupervised)
- Learns data distribution and isolates outliers.
- Requires no labels.
- Identifies both point anomalies (sudden spikes) and subtle shifts.
- Parameters:
  - `n_estimators = 200`
  - `contamination = 0.05`
- Output: anomaly score and binary anomaly flag.

#### (2) LSTM Autoencoder (Deep Learning)
- Sequence model that reconstructs normal time-series patterns.
- Trained to minimize reconstruction loss on normal segments.
- Large reconstruction error → anomaly.
- Architecture:
  - Encoder: [LSTM(64) → LSTM(32)]
  - Bottleneck: RepeatVector
  - Decoder: [LSTM(32) → LSTM(64)]
  - Output: Dense per time-step
- Trained with early stopping on validation loss.

## 4. Model Evaluation

Since labels are not provided:
- Assumed first 70% of data is normal, last 30% may contain anomalies.
- Computed approximate metrics:
  - **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1-score**, **ROC-AUC**
- Verified anomaly positions visually against RMS vibration trend.

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1 | ROC-AUC | Observation |
|--------|------------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Isolation Forest | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.15 | 0.69 | Catches spikes, limited temporal awareness |
| LSTM Autoencoder | 0.25 | 0.32 | 0.28 | 0.75 | Detects contextual drifts and degradation |

## 5. Visual Analysis

1. **Feature Distributions**  
   Plotted histograms for mean, std, RMS, skewness to inspect feature spread.

2. **Anomaly Visualization**  
   RMS vibration plotted over time with anomaly flags:
   - Red markers = Isolation Forest anomalies
   - Black markers = LSTM Autoencoder anomalies
   - LSTM captured smooth degradation earlier.

3. **Reconstruction Error Curve**  
   Error increased steadily as failure approached.

---

## 6. Key Findings & Insights

- Isolation Forest is quick and interpretable but misses temporal context.
- LSTM Autoencoder effectively models time dependencies and captures gradual faults.
- Rolling statistics and RMS are critical features for bearing diagnostics.
- Combining both models can produce a robust hybrid anomaly detection system.

---

## 7. Limitations & Future Work

- Dataset lacks explicit labels → evaluation based on heuristic assumptions.
- Reconstruction threshold tuning affects results.
- Autoencoder model may overfit if sequence length or latent size not tuned properly.

**Future Improvements:**
- Incorporate labeled benchmark datasets (e.g., NAB or SWaT).
- Use sensor fusion (combine vibration, temperature, and pressure data).
- Integrate real-time streaming and alert system.
- Add explainability tools (e.g., SHAP for anomaly attribution).

---

## 8. Business Relevance

This anomaly detection pipeline enables:
- **Predictive maintenance** (detect issues before catastrophic failure)
- **Reduced downtime and maintenance cost**
- **Improved reliability** in manufacturing operations

---

## 9. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a real-world AI/ML engineering task —  
from data understanding, feature creation, and model training to visualization and analysis.  
The system is ready for deployment with further fine-tuning and can easily adapt to any IoT sensor setup.
